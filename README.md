# Iris Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model to classify Iris species based on petal and sepal dimensions. The model is trained using the famous Iris dataset and is deployed with a simple UI using **Streamlit**.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Flow of the Project

1. **Data Collection**: The Iris dataset is loaded.
2. **Preprocessing**: EDA and feature analysis are done.
3. **Model Training**: Algorithms are tested and tuned.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using key metrics.
5. **Deployment**: A UI is created with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Outcome

- The model achieves **90%+ accuracy**.
- It successfully classifies the three iris species.
- Insights from feature importance are documented.
